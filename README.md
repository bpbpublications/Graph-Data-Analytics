## About the Book
For most modern-day data, graph data models are proving to be advantageous since they facilitate a diverse range of data analyses. This has spiked the interest and usage of graph databases, especially Neo4j. We study Neo4j and cypher along with various plugins that augment database capabilities in terms of data types or facilitate applications in data science and machine learning using plugins like graph data science (GDS).

A significant portion of the book is focused on discussing the structure and usage of graph algorithms. Readers will gain insights into well-known algorithms like shortest path, PageRank, or Label Propagation among others, and how one can apply these algorithms in real-world scenarios within a Neo4j graph.

Once readers become acquainted with the various algorithms applicable to graph analysis, we transition to data science problems. Here, we explore how a graph's structure and algorithms can enhance predictive modeling, prediction of connections in the graph, etc. In conclusion, we demonstrate that beyond its prowess in data analysis, Neo4j can be tweaked in a production setup to handle large data sets and queries at scale, allowing more complex and sophisticated analyses to come to life.
